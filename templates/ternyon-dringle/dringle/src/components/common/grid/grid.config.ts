/**
 * Adaptive scaling grid configuration.
 *
 * The grid keeps a rem-based design proportional across viewports by scaling
 * the root (`<html>`) font-size. Each breakpoint maps a viewport `maxWidth` to
 * the design `baseWidth` it was laid out at — at `baseWidth` the root
 * font-size equals `FONT_BASE` and rem values match the design 1:1.
 *
 * - Scaling DOWN (viewport at or below `GRID_BASE_WIDTH`) is driven by the
 *   `vw` media queries in `src/app/globals.css`.
 * - Scaling UP (viewport above `GRID_BASE_WIDTH`) is driven at runtime by the
 *   `AdaptiveGrid` component / `useAdaptiveGrid` hook.
 *
 * Changing these values means updating the `html` media queries in
 * `globals.css` to match — the formula is:
 *   font-size: FONT_BASE * 100 / baseWidth  (vw)

 * This project ships a single 1440px design (the home hero) that must fill the
 * viewport at every resolution, so there is one base width (1440). Scale-down is
 * the uniform `1.111111vw` rule in `globals.css`; scale-up above 1440 is the
 * `AdaptiveGrid` component (mounted with `coef={1}` for a fully proportional,
 * un-damped fit). Add per-breakpoint bases here again if a multi-layout design
 * is introduced.
